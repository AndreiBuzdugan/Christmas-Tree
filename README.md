By utilizing two Arduino boards, the project consists of a set of lights and the playback of the song "Merry Christmas." The code that controls the lights was loaded onto an Arduino Uno board, while the code used to play the song was loaded onto an Arduino Nano board. A buzzer was utilized to produce the sounds of the melody. The project was successfully implemented using these components and the corresponding code.
