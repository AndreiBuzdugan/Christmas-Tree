Using two Arduino boards, I have developed a project consisting of a set of lights and the playback of the song "Merry Christmas." The code to control the lights was loaded onto an Arduino Uno board, while the code to play the song was loaded onto an Arduino Nano board, utilizing a buzzer to produce the sounds of the melody. The project was successfully implemented using these components and the corresponding code.
